# Netcade

## About

Netcade is a website project that I made for people in school and was made with HTML and JavaScript; it features:
* A collection of popular HTML5 and Flash games
* A set of tools and pro‎xies to unbl‎ock the web
* JavaScript bookmarklets that can run scripts on your page
* Soon to come cinema page to watch movies and series

## Deploying a Netcade instance

You can copy the Netcade repository from this GitHub page and host it yourself either on a service like Netlify or Heroku or by forking the project and hosting it on a new GitHub Pages website. If you choose to do this, please make sure that the website credits me in the page footer. 

In the event that the website is blo‎cked for you, you can use the link of a different Netcade instance. Alternatively, you can use the Netcade Loader bookmarklet, which loads an IFrame element with Netcade on and appends it to your current page. Note that this script will only function on URLs beginning with http://, https:// or file:// and do not work on chrome:// sites which include the new tab page.
